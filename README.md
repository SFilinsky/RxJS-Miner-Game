# RxJS-Miner-Game
This is my RxJS project implementing Minesweeper game. 

I implemented it long time ago to train in managing many streams and implement different kinds of things with them (to name some: reactive forms, game loops, user input).

It's far from perfect, but I learned many things about RxJs with it and started using it better in Angular. It helped me to grow my knowledge even more later for doing really advanced things with it.
